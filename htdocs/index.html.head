<font size="+1"><b>Description:</b></font><br>
SharedSecret is a program used to negotiate a shared secret (password) between
two hosts in secure way over the Internet. It is written in C, based on
client/server architecture with initial intention to run on POSIX-Compliant Operating Systems.
Client application is provided, so it could be used to agree on password
between two users or create preshared-key for VPN. It could also be used from
other applications; possibly simple API will be provided to hide communication
details. The 1st version of protocol is going to support digitally signed requests/responses.
Signature can be calculated with pre-shared key as HMAC-SHA1 digest or MD5 hash values
with RSA encryption.
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Functionality Overview:</b></font><br>
Functionality is quite simple. A daemon is running on each side (no root
privileges required) which accepts requests from peer and initiates key exchange
upon client request. It uses Diffie-Hellman key agreement algorithm and very
simple protocol based on TCP to exchange payloads. See
