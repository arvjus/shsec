Install instructions for SharedSecret
=====================================

Dependencies
------------

Before you begin, make sure following software is installed:
* make, gcc with standard libraries.
* yacc, lex - (to have bison and/or lex is sufficient)
* autoconf, automake - optional (to be able to build software from CVS)
* gnugetopt - required to be abe to build on FreeBSD system.
* GNU gdbm - It was tested with 1.8.0 version.
* openssl - It was tested with 0.9.7d version.  
* libtasn1 (ftp://ftp.gnutls.org/pub/gnutls/libtasn1/) - It was tested with
  0.2.6 version.


Get source code and unpack
--------------------------

The latest version could be downloaded from 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/shsec/
Unpack archive:

$ tar -xzf shsec-0.x.x-tar.gz


Default installation
--------------------

$ cd shsec
$ ./configure
$ make && make install

The default prefix is '/usr', so it requires root privileges to install here.


Installing with another location
--------------------------------

It is possible to change destination directories and intall programs wherever 
priveleges of the current user allow to do that. All destination directories
are related to prefix directory with two exceptions:
1. if prefix='/usr' or prefix='/usr/local', then the local state directory 
   is set to '/var'. 
2. if prefix='/usr', then system config directory set to '/etc'. It is for
   daemon configuration file.

The followed configuration options could be used with ./configure script:

--prefix=PREFIX
Base directory to all location with exceptions had mentioned above.

--bindir=DIR
Client program 'shsec' is installed here.

--sbindir=DIR
Daemon program 'shsecd' is installed here.

--sysconfdir=DIR
Configuration file 'shsecd.conf' for daeomon goes here.

--localstatedir=DIR
A 'run/shsec' dir is created, related to the local state 
directory. Daeomon pid file, key database, unix socket files are created 
here, when daemon runs.

--mandir=DIR
shsec(1), shsecd(8), shsecd.conf(5) manuals.

--datadir=DIR
A 'doc/shsec-x.x.x' dirextory is created under data dir, and all other 
documetation, readme file, this install file, etc. are installed here.


Restrict access to local clients
--------------------------------

In order to restrict access to local clients, create an unix group in
/etc/group with a name 'shsec' with any unsused group id. So only members
of 'shsec' group will be permitted access to use the programs. This must be
done _before_  running './configure'. If no 'shsec' group has been found 
during configuration, gid=0 is used. Note all this client restriction stuff
works only if daemon is run by root. If daemon is run by any non-priveleged 
user, regular file-related restrictions apply. See shsecd(8) and shsecd.conf(5) 
for further information.


Build/install software from CVS
-------------------------------

$ mkdir shsec && cd shsec
$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/shsec update .
$ ./cvs-make-rel [--prefix=PREFIX ...]
$ make install

All arguments given to './cvs-make-rel' are sent to './configure' script.
Note  to be able to build the software in this way, autoconf, automake
packages are required.


Uninstall software
------------------

$ make uninstall
